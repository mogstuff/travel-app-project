This is the final Capstone project in the [Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)

## Specifications

Build a travel application where users complete a simple form entering the location they are traveling to and the date they are leaving.  If the trip is within a week get the current weather forecast, if it is in the future then get a predicted forecast.
